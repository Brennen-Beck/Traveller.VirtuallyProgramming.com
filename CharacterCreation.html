    <h2>Detailed Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Roll Characteristics (pg. 8-9)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Roll <strong>2D6</strong> six times and assign the scores to the following attributes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength (STR)</strong>: Physical strength and forcefulness.</li>
        <li><strong>Dexterity (DEX)</strong>: Coordination and reflexes.</li>
        <li><strong>Endurance (END)</strong>: Stamina and resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Intellect (INT)</strong>: Quickness of mind and intelligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Education (EDU)</strong>: Formal learning and knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Standing (SOC)</strong>: Position in society.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Dice Modifiers (DM):</strong> Calculate the DM for each attribute using the table:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>0-2 = -2</li>
        <li>3-5 = -1</li>
        <li>6-8 = +0</li>
        <li>9-11 = +1</li>
        <li>12-14 = +2</li>
        <li>15+ = +3</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Alternate Rules:</strong> Assign scores in any order or roll attributes sequentially.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Background Skills (pg. 9)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Determine Number of Skills:</strong> Calculate <strong>EDU DM + 3</strong> to determine how many background skills your character receives.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose Skills:</strong> Select from the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Admin, Animals, Art, Athletics, Carouse, Drive, Electronics, Flyer, Language, Mechanic, Medic, Profession, Science, Seafarer, Streetwise, Survival, Vacc Suit.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>These skills represent the character's adolescence and basic societal functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Pre-Career Education (Optional) (pg. 13)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Before starting a career, you may attend <strong>University</strong> or a <strong>Military Academy</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Entry Roll:</strong> Roll 2D6. A failed roll forces the character to start a career instead.</li>
      <li>Success allows access to specific skills or bonuses.</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Each education term lasts four years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Career Selection (pg. 11-12)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a career that reflects the character’s path before adventuring. Careers include <strong>Agent, Merchant, Drifter, etc.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Entry Roll:</strong> Each career has specific requirements. Failing this roll may force a draft or alternate career.</li>
      <li><strong>Assignments:</strong> Choose a sub-specialization within the career.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 5: Career Development (pg. 12-50)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each career term represents four years. For each term:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Survival Roll:</strong> Determine if the character continues in their career.</li>
          <li><strong>Events:</strong> Roll 2D6 on the career’s Event Table for significant events.</li>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Gain career-related skills and specializations.</li>
          <li><strong>Advancement Roll:</strong> Check if the character advances in rank.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mishaps:</strong> Failing a Survival Roll forces the character out of the career and results in a Mishap.</li>
      <li><strong>Connections Rule</strong> (pg. 19): Collaborate with other players to establish character ties and backstory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 6: Benefits and Aging (pg. 49)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Upon leaving a career, roll for cash and equipment benefits based on career rank.</li>
      <li><strong>Aging:</strong> If the character is 34 or older, roll for aging effects. Attributes may degrade over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 7: Finalizing the Character (pg. 50-57)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Choose Goals:</strong> Define the character’s motivations and objectives.</li>
      <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Establish Allies, Rivals, and Enemies.</li>
      <li><strong>Skill Packages:</strong> Select a group skill package to round out the party’s capabilities. Examples include <strong>Starship, Explorer, and Criminal Packages</strong> (pg. 50).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Augments:</strong> Characters may purchase biological or cybernetic enhancements later in the game (pg. 106).</li>
      <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Refer to page 97 for gear and weapons.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these steps, you will create a richly detailed character ready to explore the universe of <em>Traveller</em>. Let me know if you'd like a more interactive walkthrough or examples!</p>
